# Natural Disaster Tweet Classification App Powered By Streamlit

The goal of this project is to develop a machine-learning model that can accurately classify tweets that refer to real natural disasters and those that do not. For this purpose, I leveraged a BERT pre-trained model and trained it on the dataset provided by the Kaggle competition. After training, I optimized the hyperparameters and saved the best model checkpoint. To demonstrate the model's performance, I also created a Streamlit App that allows users to enter a tweet and see the model's prediction of whether it is about a natural disaster or not.
