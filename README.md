# Natural Disaster Tweet Classification App Powered By Streamlit

This project is based on a Kaggle competition that challenges participants to create a machine learning model that can classify tweets as related to real natural disasters or not. 
I used a BERT pre-trained model and trained it on the given dataset, then I fine-tuned the hyperparameters and saved the checkpoint. 
I also built a Streamlit App that lets users test the model and see if a tweet is about a natural disaster or not.
